Programming is a powerful tool that can be human-engineered
to create programs that are easy to use and understand. 
Just like reading — or leitura — is a fundamental 
ferramenta for personal desenvolvimento, 
programming also requires a solid foundation built by consistent practice and learning.

From infância, cultivating the hábito of reading helps 
expand vocabulário, criatividade, and pensamento crítico. 
Similarly, programming nurtures logical thinking and problem-solving skills by encouraging the creation of clear and efficient programs. 
Both activities allow us to explore histórias 
and conhecimentos beyond our immediate surroundings.

Through reading and programming, we gain new perspectives
 of the mundo and enrich our experiências pessoais. 
They are complementary ferramentas that stimulate the mind, 
helping individuals be more adaptable and innovative in various contexts.

Ultimately, whether through leitura or coding, 
the goal is to develop skills that make complex ideas easy to grasp and apply. 
By integrating these practices into daily life, 
we foster a mindset that is curious, critical, and ready to tackle challenges.
